# Vagrant Deployed Mesos Cluster with Calico
This guide will start a running Mesos cluster with Calico Networking using a simple `vagrant up`. 
It automates the the same installation procedure that is documented in the [RPM Installation Guide](RpmInstallCalicoMesos.md).

This guide will start two VMs on your hypervisor with the following layout:
### Master
All services on Master are installed from official upstream RPMs.
 * **OS**: `Centos`
 * **Hostname**: `calico-01`
 * **IP**: `172.18.8.101`
 * **Running Services**:
   * `mesos-master`
   * `etcd`
   * `zookeeper`
   * `marathon`

### Agent
The Mesos Agent is configured with several custom RPMs. Mesos is installed with Netmodules using the Netmodules RPM bundle, and Calico is added and configured using the calico-mesos.rpm provided in this repository. Once both are installed, the agent will match the following specification:
 * **OS**: `Centos`
 * **Hostname**: `calico-02`
 * **IP**: `172.18.8.102`
 * **Running Services**:
   * `mesos-agent`
 * **Docker Containers**:
   * `calico-node`
   * `calico-libnetwork`

## Prerequisites
This guide requires a hypervisor with the following specs:

 * [VirtualBox][virtualbox] to host the Mesos master and slave virtual machines
 * [Vagrant][vagrant] to run the script that provisions the Virtual Machines
 * 4+ GB memory
 * 2+ CPU
 * ~16GB available storage space


## Getting Started
1. First, download the demo:
  ```
  curl -O https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-mesos-deployments/archive/master.tar.gz
  tar -xvf calico-mesos-deployments-master.tar.gz
  cd calico-mesos-deployments-master
  ```

2. Then launch the Vagrant demo:
  ```
  vagrant up
  ```

You can log into each machine by running:
```
vagrant ssh <HOSTNAME>
```

### Adding More Agents
You can modify the script to use multiple agents. To do this, modify the `num_instances` variable
in the `Vagrantfile` to be greater than `2`.  The first instance created is the master instance, every 
additional instance will be an agent instance.

Every agent instance will take similar form to the agent instance above:

 * **OS**: `Centos`
 * **Hostname**: `calico-0X`
 * **IP**: `172.18.8.10X`
 * **Running Services**:
   * `mesos-agent`
 * **Docker Containers**:
   * `calico-node`
   * `calico-libnetwork`

where `X` is the instance number.
 
Each agent instance will require additional storage and memory resources.
